# Dynamic marker -> pattern edges (markers not in static KG).
# Each marker can link to existing patterns with relation and rationale.
# Only edges whose pattern_id is in the current case signals and subgraph are added.
ANC:
  - pattern_id: p_inflam_iron_seq
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Elevated ANC can support inflammatory context; leukocytosis often accompanies acute or chronic inflammation."

# sTfR (soluble transferrin receptor): elevated supports true iron deficiency; helps differentiate from anemia of inflammation.
sTfR:
  - pattern_id: p_iron_def
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Elevated sTfR supports true iron deficiency; helps differentiate from inflammation-mediated iron sequestration."
Soluble transferrin receptor:
  - pattern_id: p_iron_def
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Elevated sTfR supports true iron deficiency; helps differentiate from anemia of inflammation."
