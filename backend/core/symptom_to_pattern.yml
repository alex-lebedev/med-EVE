# Default symptom/free-text -> pattern mapping (rule-based suggestion; MedGemma judges keep/change).
# Each key is a keyword (lowercase); value is list of { pattern_id, relation, rationale }.
fatigue:
  - pattern_id: p_inflam_iron_seq
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Fatigue commonly accompanies anemia of inflammation."
  - pattern_id: p_iron_def
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Fatigue is a common symptom of iron deficiency anemia."
tired:
  - pattern_id: p_inflam_iron_seq
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Tiredness often accompanies chronic inflammation and anemia."
vegan:
  - pattern_id: p_iron_def
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Plant-based diet can increase risk of iron deficiency."
vegetarian:
  - pattern_id: p_iron_def
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Vegetarian diet can increase risk of iron deficiency."
elderly:
  - pattern_id: p_inflam_iron_seq
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Elderly patients are at higher risk for anemia of chronic disease."
chronic disease:
  - pattern_id: p_inflam_iron_seq
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Chronic disease is associated with inflammation-mediated iron sequestration."
inflammatory:
  - pattern_id: p_inflam_iron_seq
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Explicit inflammatory context supports inflammation-mediated iron pattern."
shortness of breath:
  - pattern_id: p_iron_def
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Shortness of breath can occur in anemia due to reduced oxygen carrying capacity."
  - pattern_id: p_inflam_iron_seq
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Shortness of breath can occur in anemia of inflammation."
weakness:
  - pattern_id: p_iron_def
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Weakness is a common symptom of iron deficiency."
  - pattern_id: p_inflam_iron_seq
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Weakness can accompany anemia of inflammation."
cold intolerance:
  - pattern_id: p_hypothyroid
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Cold intolerance is a classic symptom of hypothyroidism."
weight gain:
  - pattern_id: p_hypothyroid
    relation: SUPPORTS
    rationale: "Weight gain can be associated with hypothyroidism."
