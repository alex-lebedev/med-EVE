Maybe do a very thorough revision of the code and architecture of this decision making.. Look, the knowledge graph should represent relevant medical knowledge.. For some conditions like anemia these clear algorithms are very useful, but for others it would be best to think outside the box.. My intention was to essentially implement both of these possibilities and unblackboxing AI reasoning by asking it to also illustrate when it comes up with a novel idea that does not fir the algorithm or a known graph of relationships (look e.g. ).. Is there a way to opimise it better
